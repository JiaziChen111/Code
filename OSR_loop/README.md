  - File **OSR_loop.mod** illustrates how to use OSR utility in Dynare to search for the Taylor-rule coefficients that minimize the loss function of the monetary authority while looping over the weights of the loss function, so that for each set of preferences, an optimal rule simple rule is derived by solving the linear-quadratic problem faced by the policy-maker.
