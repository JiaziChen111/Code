## Calibrate\_shock\_size

  - File **calibrate_shock_size.m** illustrates how to calibrate the size of a shock in your model such that it produces 
    a desired response in a variable of interest.
  
  - A simple application of the code is: "How large a wage mark-up shock shall be to move inflation by **x** percent?".
  
  - A more appealing question this shock can answer is: "For two shocks that generate the same response in GDP, **which of the two is the most inflationary?**".
