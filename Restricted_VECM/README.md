## Restricted\_VECM : A simple empirical exploration of the expectations theory of the term structure of the interest rate.

  - <sub>R script **restricted\_VECM.R** offers an example on how to test for cointegration using a restricted VECM approach. Are the Swedish STIBOR and the 10-year Swedish government bond cointegrated series? With the restricted VECM approach I use Johansen's procedure to test whether the spread between the two is stationary by assuming cointegration by imposing rescritions on the $\betas$ of the VECM representation.</sub>
