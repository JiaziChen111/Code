## Restricted\_VECM : A super simple empirical exploration of the expectations theory of the term structure of the interest rate.

  - <sub>R script **restricted\_VECM.R** offers an example on how to test for cointegration using a restricted VECM approach. Are the Swedish STIBOR and the 10-year Swedish government bonds cointegrated series? With the restricted VECM approach I use Johansen's procedure to test whether the spread between the two is stationary by imposing restrictions on the coefficients of the VECM representation.</sub>  
- <sub> Dataset **cointegration.txt** contains data on Swedish STIBOR and the 10-year Swedish government bonds, downloaded from the  [Swedish Central Bank](https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/statistics/).</sub>
