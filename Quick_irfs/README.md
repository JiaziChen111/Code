## Quick\_irfs

  -  At times, you are just curious to see how your model is doing and quickly check the path of some key endogenous variables. 
  - File **quick_irfs.m** illustrates how to quickly plot and save the Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) generated by a shock in your own DSGE model, using a simple GUI to select the shocks of interest.
  - Quick and easy, yet still aesthetically appealing!
 - **Curiosity: To modify my script, apply it to three variants of Smets and Wouters (2007), a sizable medium scale DSGE model, and plot IRFs of the three models together takes about 15 minutes !!!**
