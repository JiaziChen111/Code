## Efficient\_frontier

  - Function **eff\_frontier.m** was written by [Daniele
    Vettorel](http://vettorel.mit.edu/) and me. It computes the
    efficient frontier, also called Taylor (volatility) frontier, of
    monetary policy. It shows the trade-offs available to the central
    bank, assuming the central bank implements a Taylor rule. Flexible
    and easy-to-use, it can be applied to any monetary DSGE
    model\!
  - Illustrative example: ![Example:

  - File **eff\_frontier\_example.m** provides a minimal working
    example to illustrate the power of **eff\_frontier.m**. The use of a
    three-mandate Taylor rule is illustrated.
